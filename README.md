# ADVOperation

Advanced Operation is a collection of classes that enhance the `NSOperation` class of Apple.

The library classes are provided by Apple in the WWDC 2015 [Advanced-NSOperations](https://developer.apple.com/sample-code/wwdc/2015/downloads/Advanced-NSOperations.zip) sample code.

As stated in the [session 226](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=226) of WWDC 2015 these classes are used in the Apple WWDC application itself, and they are stable.
